Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the \[Job Title] position at \[Company Name]. With over 4 years of hands-on experience in software engineering and IT support roles at Infosys and Cisco, I bring a strong foundation in API development, automation, and technical troubleshooting across high-performance systems.

My professional journey includes developing and maintaining enterprise-grade APIs using Java, Spring Boot, MuleSoft, and Python, handling 5M+ daily transactions with 99.99% uptime. I‚Äôve also delivered impactful automation solutions using UiPath that saved over 200 manual hours monthly. In addition, I have experience with Kafka-based telemetry pipelines, network performance tuning (Linux/Wireshark), and secure integrations with tools like CyberArk.

Beyond development, I‚Äôve actively worked on production issue resolution, log analysis, and service reliability engineering, making me well-equipped for a hybrid role that demands both support and development acumen.

I am excited about the opportunity to bring my technical depth and problem-solving skills to your team. I would welcome the chance to contribute to your projects and help drive innovative solutions.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to \[Company Name]'s success.
